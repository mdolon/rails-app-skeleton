# README

This is just a simple starting point for a basic Rails app. It includes:
- Webpacker
- React
- HAML
- Bulma

To use this, you will have to run the following commands:
1. Git clone this repo to a folder
2. Search for all instances of 'skeleton' and replace it with your app name
3. Run `bundle install; yarn install`
4. Run `rails db:create`

You should be good to go after that.

TODO:
- Add Devise
- Add email support (likely SendGrid)
